            No idea. Just do what I do: hold tight and pretend it's a plan. I need...I need...I need...
            fish fingers and custard! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. Overconfidence, this, and a small
            screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Brave heart, Clara. There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's
            go and poke it with a stick. There are fixed points throughout time where things must stay exactly the
            way they are. This is not one of them. This is an opportunity! Whatever happens here will create its own
            timeline, its own reality, a temporal tipping point. The future revolves around you, here, now, so do good!</p>

          <p>
            Come along, Pond! Oh, I always rip out the last page of a book. Then it doesn't have to end. I hate endings!
            Goodbye, Clara. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Bow ties are cool. It's a fez. I wear a fez
            now. Fezzes are cool. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. Father Christmas.
            Santa Claus. Or, as I’ve always known him, Jeff. I once spent a hell of a long time trying to get a gobby
            Australian to Heathrow airport. You are the only mystery worth solving.</p>

            <p>
              Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose.
              So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans
              on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped
              you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. I know. Dinosaurs! On a spaceship! Thank you,
              Strax. And if I'm ever in need of advice from a psychotic potato dwarf, you'll certainly be the first to know.</p>
